Ridge & Lasso Regression

- Assign the data with target values 𝑦 = sin(𝑥1 + 5𝑥2) polluted by random noise. 
- Use LinearRegression model in sk-learn to train the dataset. 
- Use PolynomialFeatures to map the generated dataset into higher dimension space and train the dataset with LinearRegression model.

SVM (Support vector machines)

- Use SVM model in sklearn to fit the training data.
- Train the models using different kernels and visualize decision boundaries. Evaluate the models with test accuracy.
